## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

### What Will Make or Break This

✅ **DO THIS:**
1. Build safety router FIRST (before any user testing)
2. Test voice latency on real devices early
3. Create 10 sample lessons, test with users, then scale
4. Test IAP extensively in sandbox
5. Start beta testing by Week 11 (feedback matters)

❌ **AVOID THIS:**
1. Skipping safety/moderation (legal/PR risk)
2. Optimizing avatar before voice works (wrong priority)
3. Creating all 90 lessons before user testing (waste)
4. Assuming IAP works without device testing
5. Launching without beta user feedback
