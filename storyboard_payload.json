The output should be a markdown-formatted table with columns for Shot Number, Timecode (e.g., 00:00-00:03), Visual Description, and SFX/Music Cues. The content must cover all 24 specific shots as detailed in the creative brief, starting with 'Black -> hammer spark' and ending with 'CTA UI'. For each shot, provide a vivid visual description and specific sound design notes. For example, for the 'Workshop wide' shot, describe the heat shimmer and glinting gold fittings, and for 'Reins closeup', mention the macro shot of stitching. Ensure all 24 shots are included and follow the provided sequence exactly."
