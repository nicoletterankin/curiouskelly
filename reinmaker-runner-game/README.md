## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (opens at http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build optimized version
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🎯 Controls

- **SPACE** or **UP ARROW** or **Click/Tap**: Jump
- **R**: Restart (after game over)

## 📦 Deployment to Itch.io

### Step 1: Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with your game.

### Step 2: Prepare for Itch.io

1. Zip the contents of the `dist/` folder (not the folder itself)
2. Go to [itch.io](https://itch.io)
3. Create a new project → "HTML"
4. Upload the zip file
5. Check "This file will be played in the browser"
6. Set viewport dimensions: 800 x 600
7. Enable fullscreen button (optional)
8. Save & Publish!

### Step 3: Settings

Recommended Itch.io settings:
- **Kind of project**: HTML
- **Viewport dimensions**: 800 x 600
- **Fullscreen button**: Yes
- **Mobile friendly**: Yes (touch controls work)
- **Frame options**: None

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Phaser 3.85**: Game framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Arcade Physics**: Simple 2D physics
