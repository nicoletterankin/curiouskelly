## 📚 Knowledge Base

### What Works

#### Character Consistency Prompts
- **Template:** "Maintain exact facial features, hair color (medium brown with caramel/honey-blonde highlights), skin tone (warm light-medium), eye color (warm brown almond-shaped), and overall appearance from reference images."
- **Effectiveness:** High - consistently produces accurate character
- **Usage:** Include in all Kelly prompts

#### Reference Image Usage
- **Best Practice:** Use wardrobe-specific reference images
- **Daily Lesson:** `kelly_profile.png` (Director's Chair variant)
- **Reinmaker:** `kelly_three_quarter.png` (Reinmaker outfit)
- **Effectiveness:** High - significantly improves consistency

#### Negative Prompts
- **Template:** Mandatory negative prompts block unwanted styles
- **Effectiveness:** High - prevents common mistakes
- **Usage:** Always include in all prompts

### What Doesn't Work

#### Common Failures
1. **Generic Prompts:** "A woman named Kelly" - too vague
2. **Missing Reference Context:** Not mentioning reference images
3. **Weak Negative Prompts:** Not blocking unwanted styles
4. **Inconsistent Wording:** Changing character description

#### Edge Cases That Fail
1. **Extreme Angles:** Top-down or bottom-up views
2. **Busy Backgrounds:** Complex scenes distract from Kelly
3. **Action Poses:** Running/jumping can distort features
4. **Different Lighting:** Dramatic lighting can change appearance

### Prompt Templates

#### Template 1: Reinmaker Variant (Full Body)
```
[Scene Description], featuring [Kelly Character Base], [Reinmaker Wardrobe], [Pose], [Lighting], photorealistic digital human, modern timeless aesthetic, professional photography quality, high detail, realistic skin textures, realistic fabric textures, realistic metallic surfaces.

Maintain exact facial features, hair color (medium brown with caramel/honey-blonde highlights), skin tone (warm light-medium), eye color (warm brown almond-shaped), and overall appearance from reference images. Match the reference image character appearance precisely. Use kelly_three_quarter.png as primary reference for this Reinmaker variant.

Avoid: [Mandatory Negative Prompts]
```

#### Template 2: Daily Lesson Variant (Portrait)
```
[Scene Description], featuring [Kelly Character Base], [Daily Lesson Wardrobe], [Pose], [Lighting], photorealistic digital human, modern timeless aesthetic, professional photography quality, high detail, realistic skin textures, realistic fabric textures.

Maintain exact facial features, hair color (medium brown with caramel/honey-blonde highlights), skin tone (warm light-medium), eye color (warm brown almond-shaped), and overall appearance from reference images. Match the reference image character appearance precisely. Use kelly_profile.png as primary reference for this Daily Lesson variant.

Avoid: [Mandatory Negative Prompts]
