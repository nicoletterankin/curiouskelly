## December 2024

### Date: December 2024 (Initial Setup)

**Focus Area:** Framework Creation

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Created `KELLY_QUALITY_EVALUATION.md` - Complete evaluation framework
- [x] Created `KELLY_CURRENT_STATE_ASSESSMENT.md` - Baseline assessment
- [x] Created `KELLY_BLENDER_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` - Eyelid cleanup guide
- [x] Created `KELLY_HAIR_SELECTION_GUIDE.md` - Hair selection guide
- [x] Created `KELLY_WORK_LOG.md` - This work log

**Issues Encountered:**
- Baseline measurements not yet completed (need to verify SubD level, vertex count, texture resolution)

**Solutions Applied:**
- Created comprehensive framework documents
- Established baseline assessment with known issues documented

**Scores Updated:**
- Overall: TBD (baseline assessment in progress)
- Eyelid Cleanliness: 1.0/5 (critical issue identified)
- Unity Integration: 2.0/5 (connection missing)
- Performance: 5.0/5 (excellent)

**Screenshots/Assets Created:**
- None yet (need to capture current state screenshots)

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Complete baseline measurements (SubD level, vertex count, texture resolution)
- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison screenshots
- [ ] Start eyelid cleanup in Blender
- [ ] Fix Unity integration (ElevenLabs TTS connection)
- [ ] Begin hair asset selection

**Notes:**
- Framework documents created and ready for use
- Current state assessment identifies critical issues:
  1. Eyelash shadows around eyelids (Priority 1)
  2. Unity integration missing (Priority 2)
  3. Hair not started (Priority 3)
- Performance is excellent, but may change with higher-quality assets
