# Assistant Context - Curious Kellly Project
**For AI Assistant: Complete project understanding and guidelines**

---

## ✅ **CRITICAL: THE CORRECT PRODUCT VISION**

### **"The Daily Lesson" Model**
- **365 universal daily topics** (one per day of year)
- **Everyone gets the same topic** each day (community experience)
- **Kelly ages with the learner's age slider**:
  - Age 2 slider = 2-year-old Kelly (toddler voice, simple words)
  - Age 35 slider = 35-year-old Kelly (adult voice, professional tone)
  - Age 102 slider = 102-year-old Kelly (elder voice, wisdom)
- **No course tracks, no learning paths, no choice**
- **Daily ritual**: "What's today's topic?"

### **❌ NEVER Say These (Wrong Concepts)**
- "3 lesson tracks"
- "90 lessons"
- "Choose your learning path"
- "Spanish A1, Study Skills, Career Storytelling"
- "Age adaptation is just content complexity"

### **✅ ALWAYS Say These (Correct Concepts)**
- "365 universal daily topics"
- "The Daily Lesson"
- "Kelly ages with you"
- "Everyone on the same topic today"
- "Launch with 30 topics, scale to 365"

## 🎓 **User's Preferences (From Memories)**

1. **Precompute everything** - No runtime AI models, all content authored
2. **Never use browser TTS** - ElevenLabs or OpenAI voice only
3. **Step-by-step instructions** - Not multiple options
4. **Review plans before executing** - Stay on track per CLAUDE.md
5. **Complete solutions** - No simplified summaries
6. **Think through plans first** - Correct on first try
7. **Use existing codebase** - Don't create new designs
8. **At least 60min audio** - For voice training (Kelly/Ken)

---

## 💡 **What Makes This Product Special**

1. **Age-morphing Kelly** - Not just content, Kelly herself ages
2. **Universal topics** - Work for toddler through centenarian
3. **Daily community** - Everyone on same topic creates shared experience
4. **No choice paralysis** - One topic per day, come back tomorrow
5. **Viral potential** - "What's today's topic?" becomes cultural moment
