    *   *Example:* `[hammer clangs]`
    *   *Example:* `[soft, ambient music begins]`

## 2. Audio Description (AD) Script

This script provides high-level descriptive narration for the five key visual moments in the video. It is intended to be voiced in the natural pauses between dialogue or sound.

1.  A hammer sparks in darkness as it strikes a glowing piece of metal on an anvil.
2.  A woman with focused eyes, Kelly Rein, holds the luminous metal with a pair of tongs, her face illuminated by its orange glow.
3.  She plunges the hot metal into a barrel of water. Steam erupts with a loud hiss, momentarily obscuring her.
4.  Later, in a well-lit workshop, Kelly’s steady hands use a fine tool to etch an intricate design onto the now-cooled metal.
5.  Finally, she holds up the finished piece to the light: a beautifully crafted, gleaming metal feather, its details shining.
