# Art Direction & Design System: Project Chimera

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## Introduction

This document outlines the core visual identity and design principles for Project Chimera. It serves as a guide for all creative and development teams to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and thematically coherent user experience. Our guiding principle is **"Forged Knowledge"**—a world where ancient craft and natural elements are being reimagined through accessible, tangible technology.

## 1. Character: Kelly, The Teacher-Inventor

Kelly is the heart of our story. She is not a warrior by trade, but a builder, an educator, and a pragmatist. Her design must reflect her resourcefulness, intelligence, and deep connection to her community and her craft.

### 1.1. Silhouette
The silhouette should be instantly recognizable, practical, and asymmetrical. It is defined by function over form, but with a personal touch.

-   **Overall Shape:** A-line or long coat over a practical tunic and trousers. Grounded and stable.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   **Goggles:** Pushed up on her forehead or around her neck. A clear signifier of a tinkerer.
    -   **Toolbelt & Side-Pouch:** Asymmetry is key. One side is weighted with tools, scrolls, and a datapad, breaking up a simple profile.
    -   **Rolled Sleeves:** Signifies she is a hands-on builder, always ready to work.
    -   **Collar/Scarf:** A single piece of flowing fabric or a high, functional collar provides a point of contrast to the otherwise practical outfit, hinting at her connection to the 'Air' or 'Fire' motifs.

### 1.2. Materials
Materials are tangible, worn, and fused with technology. The aesthetic is "repaired and upgraded," not "new and disposable."

-   **Primary Fabric:** Heavy canvas or waxed cotton in **Forge Charcoal**. Shows wear, scuffs, and occasional stitched repairs.
-   **Leather:** Worn and oiled leather for the toolbelt, gloves, and boots in shades of **Stone Gray**.
-   **Tech Elements:** Self-illuminated cabling and data-ports woven directly into the fabric, glowing with **Circuit Teal**.
-   **Metal Accents:** Buckles, clasps, and tool parts are made of hammered, heat-patinated metal, catching the light with hints of **Ember Gold** and **Fire Rose**.
-   **Personal Item:** A polished stone or crystal, perhaps a "Knowledge Stone," worn as a pendant.

### 1.3. Motion
Kelly’s movements are deliberate, efficient, and purpose-driven.

-   **Stance:** Grounded, with a slightly wide, stable footing.
-   **Idle Animation:** Tinkering with a gadget on her wrist, checking her datapad, or scanning the horizon with a focused gaze.
-   **Movement:** A methodical walk or a brisk, energetic jog. When she acts, it is with sudden bursts of focused energy—a quick repair, a deployed tool, or a precise gesture to activate a device. Her movements tell the story of a mind that is always several steps ahead.

## 2. Symbol: The Circuit Loop

The core symbol of Kelly's tribe and ideology. It represents the evolution from the "Broken Rein" of the past to a new, interconnected future.

### 2.1. Meaning
The symbol is a direct metaphor for **liberation through knowledge and connection**.

-   **The Broken Rein:** Represents breaking free from old, rigid, top-down systems of control and information. It is the past.
-   **The Circuit Loop:** Represents a new, decentralized, and continuous flow of energy and knowledge. It is open-ended, signifying that the system is always growing and evolving. It is the future.

### 2.2. Usage
The Circuit Loop is a versatile symbol used to denote affiliation, technology, and status.

-   **Apparel:** Stamped or stitched onto Kelly’s gear (shoulder, back of a glove).
-   **Technology:** Used as a boot-up icon for the iLearn OS and etched onto the surface of tools.
-   **UI Elements:** Serves as a loading icon, a faction marker, and the basis for the "Offline-First" badge.
-   **Environment:** Carved into doorways or used as a waypoint marker in the world.

### 2.3. SVG Code
A simple, clean, and scalable version of the symbol. The break in the loop is intentional, with the ends terminating in simple nodes to represent data points.

```svg
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- The main loop, broken at the top right -->
  <path d="M 90 50 A 40 40 0 1 1 50 10"
        stroke="#00F0FF"
        stroke-width="8"
        stroke-linecap="round"/>
  <!-- The starting node of the circuit -->
  <circle cx="50" cy="10" r="5" fill="#00F0FF"/>
  <!-- The ending node of the circuit -->
  <circle cx="95" cy="50" r="5" fill="#00F0FF"/>
</svg>
```

## 3. Color Palette

The palette is a balance of grounded, natural tones and vibrant, energetic tech highlights.

| Name           | Hex       | Description                                                                 |
| :------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forge Charcoal** | `#333132` | **Primary Dark.** A deep, warm grey. The color of cooled metal and shadow.  |
| **Ember Gold**   | `#FFB800` | **Primary Action.** Bright, energetic orange-yellow. For CTAs, and warnings. |
| **Circuit Teal** | `#00F0FF` | **Primary Tech.** A vibrant cyan. For UI highlights, holograms, and energy. |
| **Stone Gray**   | `#A0A0A0` | **Secondary Neutral.** A mid-tone, calming grey. The color of carved stone. |
| **Light Lens**   | `#F5F5F0` | **Primary Light/Text.** An off-white, soft and readable. For backgrounds & text. |
| **Fire Rose**    | `#E54F6D` | **Accent/Highlight.** A striking reddish-pink. For emotional moments or heat. |

## 4. Typography

Typography must be clear, functional, and thematically appropriate. We use two main font styles.

### 4.1. Display Font
-   **Style:** A geometric sans-serif with a slightly condensed profile and squared-off terminals. Think "engraved" or "stenciled." It should feel engineered and precise.
-   **Usage:** Headlines, titles, major UI callouts (e.g., button text), and world-space signage.
-   **Example Families:** Roboto Mono, Oswald, or a custom font inspired by mechanical schematics.

### 4.2. Text Font
-   **Style:** A highly legible, humanist sans-serif. It should be clean, open, and comfortable to read in long-form paragraphs.
-   **Usage:** Body copy, descriptions, subtitles, and smaller UI labels.
-   **Example Families:** Inter, Source Sans Pro, Lato.

### 4.3. On-Screen Text Safety Guidelines
All critical text and UI elements must adhere to the following safe zones to ensure visibility on all displays.

-   **Title Safe Area:** 90% of the screen. All critical text must remain within this inner 90% boundary.
-   **Action Safe Area:** 85% of the screen. All interactive elements (buttons, icons) must be fully contained within this boundary to prevent accidental cropping.

## 5. Environment & Tribe Motifs

The visual language of the world is built on the fusion of seven core motifs. Each tribe or area might emphasize certain motifs over others.

-   **Light:** Not ambient, but *projected*. Light is focused through lenses, appears as holographic schematics, or cuts through dust in sharp rays. The visual language is about optics and data projection.
-   **Stone:** The foundation. Stone is ancient, solid, and dependable. It is often carved with intricate channels that now house glowing **Circuit Teal** cabling, showing how new technology is built upon an old foundation.
-   **Metal:** Functional and forged, not sleek or chrome. Surfaces are hammered, welded, and patinated. It shows the heat and effort of its creation, often glowing with residual heat (**Fire Rose** accents).
-   **Code:** Represented visually not as text, but as flowing, woven patterns of light. It moves like liquid energy through conduits or hangs in the air like shimmering curtains of data.
-   **Air:** Represents clarity, information, and freedom. Visually, this is seen in clean spaces, floating holographic elements, and the subtle movement of particles or data motes in the air.
-   **Water:** The coolant and power source. It is channeled through transparent pipes alongside tech, often glowing from the energy it transfers. Represents the flow of knowledge.
-   **Fire:** The forge and the heart. Fire is contained and purposeful—the focused heat of a plasma cutter, the glow of a vacuum tube, the contained energy core of a device. It is creation, not destruction.

## 6. UI Overlays (iLearn OS)

The iLearn OS is an augmented reality interface that feels tangible and diegetic. It is built on principles of clarity, accessibility, and thematic consistency.

### 6.1. Offline-First Badge
-   **Concept:** A clear indicator that a lesson or tool is fully functional without a network connection. This is a core feature representing self-reliance.
-   **Design:** A solid, filled-in version of the **Circuit Loop** symbol, rendered in **Stone Gray** or **Forge Charcoal**. It looks like a physical, self-contained token. When a connection is available but not required, a subtle pulse of **Circuit Teal** may emanate from it. It should *never* use a "slash" or "X," as offline is a feature, not an error.

### 6.2. Knowledge Stones HUD
-   **Concept:** The primary interface for accessing lessons and information. These are not flat windows but feel like physical objects in the AR space.
-   **Design:**
    -   **Shape:** Hexagonal, semi-transparent panes. The hexagonal shape allows for a honeycomb-like grid layout, reinforcing the theme of community and interconnected knowledge.
    -   **Material:** Appears like frosted or etched glass, with a **Light Lens** base color.
    -   **State:** When inactive, they are a dim **Stone Gray**. When focused or active, the borders and iconography glow brightly with **Circuit Teal**, and the pane becomes clearer.
    -   **Information:** Uses the **Display** font for titles and the **Text** font for short descriptions.

### 6.3. Lesson CTA (Call to Action) Button
-   **Concept:** The button to begin a lesson or activity. It must be inviting, clear, and satisfying to press.
-   **Design:**
    -   **Shape:** A rectangular button with slightly rounded corners and a heavier weight on the bottom edge to give it a sense of physicality.
    -   **Color:** The fill is a solid **Ember Gold**, our primary action color. The text label ("BEGIN LESSON," "CRAFT ITEM") is in **Forge Charcoal** using the **Display** font, all caps.
    -   **Interaction:**
        -   **Hover/Focus:** The button emits a soft **Ember Gold** glow, and a thin **Circuit Teal** border appears, as if it's powering up.
        -   **Click:** The button provides a crisp visual and auditory feedback, momentarily flashing **Light Lens** before transitioning to the next screen.
