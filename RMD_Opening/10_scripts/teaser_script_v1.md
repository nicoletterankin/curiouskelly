### **Teaser Script: "The Rein Maker's Daughter" (15s)**

| TIME | VISUALS | AUDIO / SFX | ON-SCREEN TEXT |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-3s** | **(HAMMER)** <br> Extreme close-up. A hand forcefully clenches a thick leather rein. The shot is tense and dynamic. <br><br> **CUT TO BLACK.** The logo pulses onto the screen with a subtle glitch effect. | **(SFX: Deep THUMP, leather stretching)** <br><br> **(SFX: Sharp electronic pulse)** | **[LOGO]** <br> THE REIN MAKER'S DAUGHTER |
| **3-9s** | **(CORE THEMATIC)** <br> **On "Reins control":** A shot from behind, showing the reins constricting someone's path or vision. The scene is dimly lit, restrictive. <br><br> **On "Lessons liberate":** A quick, fluid transition. The reins dissolve into particles of light. A woman’s face (KELLY REIN) emerges, looking up with clarity and confidence. A soft lens flare sweeps across the screen. | **(Confident, clear Female VO):** <br> "Reins control." <br><br> "...Lessons liberate." | **[Text appears in sync with VO]** <br> **REINS CONTROL.** (Heavy, serif font) <br><br> **LESSONS LIBERATE.** (Lighter, sans-serif font) |
| **9-15s** | **(CTA / END CARD)** <br> The shot of Kelly holds as she looks directly into the camera, giving a slight, knowing nod. The shot cleanly transitions to a final, minimalist end card. | **(Direct, inviting Female VO):** <br> "I’m Kelly Rein. Tap to begin Lesson 1." <br><br> **(SFX: A soft, affirmative chime)** | **[END CARD]** <br> **I’M KELLY REIN** <br><br> **[CTA Button]** <br> TAP TO BEGIN LESSON 1 <br><br> **[Symbol]** <br> A stylized ‘R’ that subtly incorporates the loop of a rein. |
