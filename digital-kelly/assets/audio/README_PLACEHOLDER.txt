KELLY AUDIO PLACEHOLDER

Do NOT commit large audio files (*.wav, *.mp3) to this repository.

Test Audio Setup:

1. Create directory: ~/DigitalKellyTest/audio
2. Place kelly_intro.wav in that directory
3. The app will load from that path at runtime

Alternatively, use the Flutter "Copy Demo Assets" button (when available)
to copy placeholder audio to the app's documents directory.

Expected format:
- WAV format
- 16-bit, 44.1kHz recommended
- Mono or Stereo (will be converted for Unity playback)

For production:
Audio files should be hosted on CDN or bundled in app resources.
Never store large binaries (>1MB) in the git repository.
