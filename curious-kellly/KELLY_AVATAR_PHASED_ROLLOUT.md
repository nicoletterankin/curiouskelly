## 🎯 Phased Approach for Kelly Avatar

Hi Arif,

After our meeting, I want to clarify our rollout strategy. We're building Kelly in **phases** to get her teaching quickly, then add capabilities as we prove the system works.

### **CURRENT FOCUS: Phase 1 - Static Upper Body**

For Milestone 2 (pipeline testing), we need:

**Model Scope:**
- **Head + Neck + Shoulders** (bust only, like a Zoom call)
- **Cut off at mid-torso** (we won't see below chest area initially)
- **Static sitting pose** (locked, no animation needed yet)
- **Simple clothing** (blue sweater visible from shoulders up)

**Critical Requirements:**
- ✅ 52 facial blendshapes (full CC4 Facial Profile)
- ✅ Eye bones (separate left/right for gaze tracking)
- ✅ Breathing morph (subtle chest movement)
- ✅ 15k-20k tris max (mobile 60 FPS target)

**Why Start Small:**
- ✅ Proves the CC4→CC5→iClone→Unity pipeline
- ✅ Gets Kelly teaching lessons THIS MONTH
- ✅ Lower poly count = easier to hit 60 FPS
- ✅ Focus on what matters most: face, eyes, expressions

**Camera View (Phase 1):**
- Tight close-up (shoulders to top of head)
- Like video call framing
- 90% of teaching happens here

---

### **MILESTONE 3: Phase 2 - Add Arms & Gestures**

After Phase 1 is tested and working, we'll add:

**Model Addition:**
- ✅ Arms + hands (to fingertips)
- ✅ Extend torso to waist
- ✅ 5-10 hand poses (point, open palm, thinking, etc.)
- ✅ Upper body morphs (lean, shoulder movement)

**New Capability:**
- Kelly can gesture during teaching
- Medium shot available (waist up)
- More engaging presence

**Poly Budget:**
- 25k-35k tris total

---

### **MILESTONE 4: Phase 3 - Full Body & Poses**

Final milestone adds:

**Model Completion:**
- ✅ Full body (head to feet)
- ✅ Complete outfit (sweater, jeans, shoes)
- ✅ 3-5 pose variants (sitting forward, sitting relaxed, standing, etc.)
- ✅ Props (chair if separate)

**New Capability:**
- Multiple contexts (intros, teaching, celebrations)
- Pose switching (blend between variants)
- Full body visible when needed

**Poly Budget:**
- 40k-60k tris with LOD system

---

### **Questions for You:**

1. **Phase 1 Scope**: Are you comfortable doing a bust-only model for Milestone 2? (Head + shoulders + basic torso, cut at mid-chest)

2. **Extensibility**: Can we build Phase 1 in a way that we can extend it downward later? (Add arms in Phase 2, legs in Phase 3)

3. **Topology**: Will the topology work if we extend the model in phases, or should you model the full body now and we just hide parts?

4. **Timeline**: Does this phased approach work with your schedule?

---

### **Recommendation:**

**Option A: Model Full Body Now, Show Parts Later**
- You build complete full body in Milestone 2
- We just hide/clip parts we don't need yet
- Easier to extend later
- Slightly higher poly count from start

**Option B: True Phased Modeling**
- Milestone 2: Bust only (15k-20k tris)
- Milestone 3: Add arms/hands (extend model)
- Milestone 4: Add lower body (extend again)
- More work in phases, but optimized at each stage

**Which approach do you prefer?** I lean toward Option A (model full body, hide parts) for simplicity, but open to your recommendation.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,  
[Your Name]

## 📊 Performance Budget Across Phases

| Phase | Poly Count | Textures | Target FPS | Est. Memory |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | 15-20k | 2048x2048 x1 | 60 FPS | 150-200 MB |
| Phase 2 | 25-35k | 2048x2048 x2 | 60 FPS | 250-300 MB |
| Phase 3 | 40-60k | 2048x2048 x3 | 60 FPS (LOD) | 350-450 MB |
| Phase 4 | 50-80k | 4096x4096 x2 | 60 FPS (LOD) | 450-600 MB |

All phases must maintain **60 FPS on iPhone 12 and Pixel 6**.

## ✅ Summary

**Phase 1 (NOW):** Face-focused teaching → Ship fast  
**Phase 2 (Next):** Add gestures → More engaging  
**Phase 3 (Later):** Full body contexts → Rich variety  
**Phase 4 (Future):** Full animation → Interactive magic  

**Current Focus:** Get Milestone 2 (Phase 1) perfect. Everything else follows.
