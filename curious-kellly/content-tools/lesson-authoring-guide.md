# Lesson Authoring Guide - Curious Kellly

## 🎯 **The Universal Lesson Concept**

Every day, **everyone learns the same topic**, but Kelly adapts her age, language, and examples to match the learner's age (2-102 years old).

**Example:**
- **Topic:** "Why Do Leaves Change Color?"
- **2-year-old sees:** 3-year-old Kelly saying "Leaves are like blankets! They change colors when it gets cold!"
- **35-year-old sees:** 27-year-old Kelly explaining chlorophyll breakdown and anthocyanin production
- **82-year-old sees:** 82-year-old Kelly reflecting on seasons of life and nature's cycles

**Everyone learns about leaves together, but in age-appropriate ways.**

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Authoring Process**

### **Step 1: Choose Your Topic** (15 min)
- Pick from curriculum list or create new
- Ensure it's universal (works for ages 2-102)
- Verify it's age-adaptable
- Check it's safe and appropriate

### **Step 2: Core Concept** (30 min)
- Write the universal truth/concept in one sentence
- Example: "Leaves change color because trees prepare for winter by breaking down chlorophyll"
- Ensure this concept can be explained at all age levels

### **Step 3: Age-Specific Content** (2-3 hours per age group)
- Start with ages 18-35 (easiest baseline)
- Then simplify for younger ages (2-5, 6-12, 13-17)
- Then add depth for older ages (36-60, 61-102)

**For each age group, write:**
1. **Welcome** (30s-1min) - Hook them in
2. **Main Content** (2-4.5min) - Core teaching
3. **Key Points** (3-5 bullet points) - Main takeaways
4. **Interaction Prompts** (3-5 questions) - Engage learner
5. **Wisdom Moment** (30s-2min) - Memorable insight

### **Step 4: Teaching Moments** (30 min per age group)
- Add 2-3 interactive moments
- Types: visual, inquiry, reflection, application, wisdom, legacy
- Include timing (when in lesson)

### **Step 5: Validate** (15 min)
```bash
node curious-kellly/content-tools/validate-lesson.js your-lesson.json
```

### **Step 6: Generate Audio** (1 hour per age group)
```bash
node curious-kellly/content-tools/generate-audio.js your-lesson.json --age-group 18-35
```

### **Step 7: Preview** (5-10 min)
```bash
node curious-kellly/content-tools/preview-lesson.js your-lesson.json --age 35
```

### **Step 8: Test** (15 min)
- Load in backend
- Test via API
- Verify all age variants work

**Total time per lesson:** ~12-15 hours (with 6 age variants)

## 🎯 **Quick Start: Your First Lesson**

**Let's create "Water" (Day 2):**

1. **Copy template:**
   ```bash
   cp curious-kellly/content-tools/lesson-template.json curious-kellly/backend/config/lessons/water-cycle.json
   ```

2. **Update metadata:**
   - id: "water-cycle"
   - title: "The Amazing Journey of Water"
   - category: "science"

3. **Write for ages 18-35 first** (baseline):
   - Welcome: "Water is everywhere—in our bodies, oceans, clouds..."
   - Main: Explain evaporation, condensation, precipitation
   - Key points: 3 states, cycle, conservation
   - Interactions: "Where do you see water transforming?"
   - Wisdom: "Water teaches us about transformation and renewal"

4. **Adapt for other ages:**
   - 2-5: "Water goes up! Water comes down! Rain!"
   - 6-12: "Let's follow a water droplet's adventure!"
   - 13-17: "Water cycle connects to climate and weather..."
   - 36-60: "Water's journey mirrors life's transitions..."
   - 61-102: "In my years, I've learned water's wisdom: adaptability..."

5. **Validate:**
   ```bash
   node curious-kellly/content-tools/validate-lesson.js water-cycle.json
   ```

6. **Done!** Move to next topic.

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Efficiency Hacks:**
1. **Batch similar ages:** Write 2-5 and 6-12 together (simplification)
2. **Use voice recorder:** Speak Kelly's voice, then transcribe
3. **Test with real people:** Get feedback from each age group
4. **Reuse structure:** Copy pacing/format from "Leaves"

### **Common Pitfalls:**
1. ❌ Making topic too narrow (e.g., "401k planning")
2. ❌ Using same language for all ages
3. ❌ Forgetting to update Kelly's age
4. ❌ Making lessons too long (respect attention spans)
5. ❌ Not testing audio flow

### **Content Sources:**
- Scientific databases (NIH, NASA, etc.)
- Educational research
- Your own life experience
- Classic literature and wisdom
- Nature observation
