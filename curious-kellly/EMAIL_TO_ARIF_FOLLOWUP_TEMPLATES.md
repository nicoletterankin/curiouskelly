## Template 1: After Receiving His Response (Questions Answered)

**Subject:** Re: Kelly Avatar - Great, Let's Proceed with [Option A/B]!

---

Hi Arif,

Perfect! Thanks for answering those questions.

**Build Approach:** Going with **Option A** [or B] as you suggested - that makes sense.

**Eye Bones:** Good to know you've [done this before / haven't tried this yet]. [If he hasn't:] Let's plan extra testing time for this since it's critical.

**Timeline:** Sounds good. I'm ready to test as soon as Milestone 1 is complete.

---

**Quick Confirmation:**

For Milestone 2 (Phase 1 testing), you'll send:
- ✅ .ccCharacter file (head + shoulders [+ full body if Option A])
- ✅ All 52 morphs (editable, not baked)
- ✅ Separate eye bones (L/R independent)
- ✅ Textures (2048x2048)
- ✅ Screenshots (morph list, eye bones, views)

I'll test within 24 hours and send detailed feedback.

---

**My Testing Checklist:**
1. Import to CC5 (verify morphs)
2. Export to iClone (test eye bones)
3. Export FBX to Unity (test blendshapes)
4. Test performance (60 FPS)
5. Test gaze tracking (eye independence)
6. Test lip-sync (mouth morphs)
7. Send you feedback with screenshots

---

Looking forward to Milestone 1 completion! Let me know when you're ready to send Phase 1.

## Template 4: If Critical Blocker Found

**Subject:** Kelly Phase 1 - CRITICAL: Eye Bones Not Working

---

Hi Arif,

I found a critical blocker in testing that we need to solve together before continuing.

---

## 🚨 **Critical Issue: Eye Bones**

**Problem:** Eye bones are [linked/missing/not exporting/not functional in iClone]

**Impact:** This blocks our entire gaze tracking system. We can't proceed without this working.

**What I Tested:**
1. Imported .ccCharacter to CC5 → [result]
2. Exported to iClone → [result]
3. Tested Face Puppet → [result]
4. [Screenshot attached showing the issue]

---

## 🔍 **Let's Research Together**

**Questions:**
1. Does CC4 create separate eye bones by default?
2. Is there a setting to enable independent eye control?
3. Have you seen this work in other CC4→iClone exports?
4. Can we check CC4 documentation together?

---

## 🔄 **Options:**

**Option A:** Research CC4 eye bone setup (I can help)  
**Option B:** Manual rig adjustment (if needed)  
**Option C:** Alternative approach (if CC4 doesn't support this)  

**I'm happy to hop on a call to troubleshoot together.** This is too important to guess at.

**Available:** [Your availability]
