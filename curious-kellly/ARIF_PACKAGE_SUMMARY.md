## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

### **In Arif's Response:**

❌ **"I usually bake morphs for export"**
→ We need morphs editable, not baked!

❌ **"CC4 doesn't have separate eye bones"**
→ CRITICAL BLOCKER - we need to research this together

❌ **"I can't test in iClone"**
→ Increases risk - we'll need extra testing time

❌ **"Full body is 100k tris"**
→ Way over budget - need optimization plan

❌ **"Morphs don't export to iClone"**
→ CRITICAL - this is what Milestone 2 is testing

### **Action if Red Flags:**
- Research solution together
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Consider alternative approaches
- Don't proceed until resolved

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Communication Style with Arif:**

✅ **Be specific:** "15-20k tris" not "low poly"  
✅ **Be visual:** Use diagrams from package  
✅ **Be phased:** Focus on Phase 1 only for now  
✅ **Be supportive:** "We'll test together" not "You must test"  
✅ **Be clear on priorities:** Eye bones > everything else

### **During Testing Phase:**

✅ **Fast turnaround:** 24-hour feedback promise  
✅ **Clear feedback:** Specific issues with screenshots  
✅ **Solution-oriented:** "Here's how to fix" not just "This is broken"  
✅ **Iterative:** Expect 2-3 rounds of fixes  
✅ **Positive:** Celebrate when things work!
