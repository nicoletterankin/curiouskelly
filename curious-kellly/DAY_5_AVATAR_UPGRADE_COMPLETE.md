## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### Immediate (User-Driven)
1. **Open Unity Project:**
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Open `digital-kelly/engines/kelly_unity_player`
   - Verify scripts compiled successfully

2. **Test in Unity Editor:**
   - Follow `QUICK_START.md` (5 minutes)
   - Click Play and verify 60fps
   - Test age buttons (5, 35, 102)

3. **Create 6 Age Variants:**
   - Import/create 6 Kelly models (ages 3, 9, 15, 27, 48, 82)
   - Assign to `KellyAvatarController.kellyAgeVariants[]`
   - Test age morphing in Play Mode

4. **Add Audio2Face Data:**
   - Place `.json` files in `Assets/Kelly/A2F/`
   - Assign to `BlendshapeDriver60fps.a2fJsonAsset`
   - Test lip-sync with audio playback

### Week 2-3 (Voice Integration)
- ✅ **Backend:** OpenAI Realtime API already integrated (Day 2)
- ⏳ **Flutter:** Integrate `flutter_webrtc` for voice streaming
- ⏳ **Unity:** Connect voice to lip-sync system
- ⏳ **Testing:** RTT <600ms target, barge-in support

### Week 3-4 (Content Creation)

- ⏳ Age-adaptive content for each topic (6 variants)
- ⏳ Audio generation with ElevenLabs/OpenAI
- ⏳ iClone animation at 60fps

### Week 4-5 (Mobile App Polish)

- ⏳ Performance profiling (60fps target on all devices)
- ⏳ Beta distribution (TestFlight 300 + Play Internal 300)
- ⏳ Crash-free rate ≥99.7%

### Week 6 (Launch)
- ⏳ App Store submission (iOS)
- ⏳ Google Play submission (Android)
- ⏳ GPT Store listing (MCP server)
- ⏳ Marketing launch

## 💡 **Key Insights**

### 1. Age Morphing is Core UX
The 6 Kelly age variants are critical to the "everyone together, same topic" vision. A 5-year-old sees a 3-year-old Kelly, a 70-year-old sees an 82-year-old Kelly—all learning about leaves together.

### 2. 60fps Makes a Difference
The jump from 30fps to 60fps is noticeable, especially for lip-sync and micro-expressions. The 16.67ms frame budget is tight but achievable on modern devices.

### 3. Gaze Tracking Adds Life
Micro-saccades and gaze following make Kelly feel "present" and engaged. The adaptive frequency (kids vs elders) adds subtle realism.

### 4. Performance Monitoring is Essential
Real-time FPS/frame time monitoring catches issues early. The color-coded status (Excellent/Good/Warning/Poor) makes performance immediately visible.

### 5. Flutter ↔ Unity Bridge is Robust
The message-based architecture scales well. JSON encoding keeps messages human-readable for debugging.
