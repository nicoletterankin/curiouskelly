# Curious Kellly — Product Manager’s Guide
**Date:** October 29, 2025

## 0. Strategy in one page
- **Problem:** Learners stall because guidance is abstract and impersonal.  
- **Bet:** A face‑to‑face, *daily* micro‑lesson from a caring avatar increases motivation and learning velocity.  
- **Measure:** Retention + measurable skill gains + high CSAT with tight safety.

## 1. Roadmap (quarters)
- **Q1 (MVP)**: Voice avatar, 3 tracks, iOS/Android, GPT Store listing, Claude Artifact demo, IAP.  
- **Q2**: Progress graph, spaced retrieval, lesson marketplace (curated creators), family plan, accessibility polish.  
- **Q3**: Classroom mode (teacher dashboard), web subscription checkout (jurisdiction‑compliant), offline caching.  
- **Q4**: AR companion mode (beta), enterprise/edu pilots.

## 2. Backlog by theme
- **Presence & polish:** barge‑in, cross‑talk handling, gaze.  
- **Learning engine:** objectives‑to‑checks mapping; mastery estimates; hint tiers.  
- **Safety:** child‑appropriate filters; crisis diversion.  
- **Trust:** “Why am I seeing this?”, editable memory; data export.  
- **Growth:** referral loops; streaks; push cadence tuning.

## 3. Experiments
- **Onboarding variants:** quiz-first vs story-first → Activation (D2).  
- **Session length:** 5 vs 12 minutes → Completion/Retention.  
- **Voice persona:** “coach” vs “guide” → CSAT; keep both if deltas are segment‑specific.  
- **Pricing:** monthly vs annual default → Trial→Pay conversion.

## 4. Metrics & instrumentation
- **Core:** DAU/WAU/MAU; D1/D7/D30; L28; p50/p95 latency; crash‑free sessions; quiz delta; CSAT; NPS.  
- **Content:** completion, hint rate, mis‑answer clustering.  
- **Safety:** flagged/blocked %, false‑positive/negative audits weekly.

## 5. Ops
- **Release trains:** weekly; feature flags for risky surfaces.  
- **Incident response:** on‑call rotation; rollback in <15 min; post‑mortems in 48 h.  
- **Data reviews:** privacy + safety councils monthly.

## 6. Go‑to‑market (stores)
- **Apple App Store:** enroll Apple Developer Program ($99/year). Respect IAP & privacy labels. Small Business Program can reduce commission to **15%** if eligible; subscriptions net **85%** after a subscriber’s first year. citeturn17search3turn17search1turn17search5  
- **Google Play:** one‑time **$25** registration; service fee **15% for first $1M/year** (then 30%); subscriptions **15% from day one**. Target **API 35** by **Aug 31, 2025**; Play Billing **v7+** by the same date. citeturn18search0turn23search0turn23search1turn11search0turn16search2  
- **OpenAI GPT Store:** publish a public GPT requires **Plus/Pro/Enterprise** and a **verified Builder Profile**. OpenAI has a builder earnings program (“Builder Rewards” / usage‑based), details subject to change. No listing fee published. citeturn19search0turn19search1  
- **Claude (Artifacts):** no formal “store.” You can **build, host, and share** interactive apps inside Claude; share links/workspaces—good for discovery and education funnels. citeturn22search0turn22search1
