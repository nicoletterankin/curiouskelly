## Age-Less Score Analysis

**Average Age-Less Score: 1.66/4** - Most tech lessons are NOT truly age-less

### Why Tech Lessons Score Low on Age-Less:
- ❌ Hard for 3-year-olds to relate (too abstract)
- ❌ Hard for 80-year-olds to relate (too technical)
- ❌ Not observable in daily life (abstract concepts)
- ❌ Not universal human experiences

### What Makes a Tech Lesson Age-Less:
- ✅ Observable (e.g., "How Light Works" - everyone sees light)
- ✅ Universal experience (e.g., "Communication" - everyone communicates)
- ✅ Simple framing (e.g., "Computers Help Us" vs. "Computer Architecture")
- ✅ Connects to daily life (e.g., "How Phones Work" vs. "Network Protocols")
