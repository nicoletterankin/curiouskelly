- ❌ "Kindness" - important but shallow
- ❌ "Play" - too simple, lacks educational value

### Higher Quality (Substantive & Educational):
- ✅ "Cooperation - How We Work Together" - deeper, teaches systems thinking
- ✅ "Compassion - Understanding and Helping Others" - more comprehensive
- ✅ "Curiosity - The Engine of Discovery" - educational, teaches inquiry
- ✅ "Observation - Learning by Paying Attention" - teaches scientific method
- ✅ "Reflection - Understanding What We've Learned" - metacognition, deeper
