# Topic Improvement Plan - Making Lessons More Age-Less & Universal

## Philosophy: Age-Less Universal Topics

An "age-less" topic is one that:
- Can be experienced/observed by anyone from 2-102 years old
- Has meaning at multiple complexity levels
- Connects to universal human experiences
- Inspires wonder across all ages
- Is culturally universal

## Current Issues

1. **Too Technology-Heavy (68.8%)** - Many lessons are about innovation, technology, systems
2. **Missing Natural Phenomena** - Clouds, rain, snow, rainbows, wind, trees, flowers
3. **Missing Universal Experiences** - Friendship, family, kindness, gratitude, curiosity
4. **Missing Simple Observations** - Shadows, reflections, colors, seasons, time
