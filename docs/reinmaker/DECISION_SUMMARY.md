## 📚 What We Decided & Why

### The Tradeoffs Explained

#### 1. **Target Audience**

- **RPG:** 25-44 years old - narrower, premium market
- **Decision Impact:** Runner Game can reach more people, validate brand faster

#### 2. **Development Complexity**
- **Runner Game:** 90% done, simple mechanics, 2-3 months to finish
- **RPG:** 0% done, complex systems, 12-18 months to build
- **Decision Impact:** Finish what you started, learn from users, then decide on RPG

#### 3. **Resource Requirements**
- **Runner Game:** $624-2,624 total, solo developer feasible
- **RPG:** $65,000-215,000 total, requires team/funding
- **Decision Impact:** Runner Game is achievable with current resources

#### 4. **Risk Level**
- **Runner Game:** Low risk (simple, almost done)
- **RPG:** High risk (complex, expensive, long timeline)
- **Decision Impact:** Lower risk = faster learning, better decision-making

#### 5. **Strategic Value**

## ❓ Questions Answered

### Q: Why not build the RPG first?
**A:** RPG is 0% done, requires 12-18 months and $65,000+. Runner Game is 90% done, requires 2-3 months and $624-2,624. Finish what you started, validate brand, then decide.

**A:** Resource constraints. Solo developer + limited budget = focus on one game. Runner Game validates brand quickly, then you can decide on RPG.
