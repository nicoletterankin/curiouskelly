# ReinMaker Mobile RPG - Positioning & Target Customer

**Document Type:** Product Positioning Document  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Related To:** ReinMaker Brand & Game Portfolio

---

## Executive Summary

ReinMaker's first mobile RPG title fills a neglected niche within the mobile games market for action role-playing games that tell powerfully immersive stories. While mobile ARPGs simplify gameplay by substituting robust storytelling and player agency, they expand focus on combat and encounter-driven design. This has paved the way for gameplay innovations but left player engagement with the central storyline behind—combat and quests become a simple grind.

**Core Belief:** Mobile technology and gamers are ready for console-level, immersive story experiences wherever they go.

## Mobile Game Design

### Core Concept
- **First-person, story-driven ARPG** designed for mobile devices and 5G technology
- **Story built with fantasy elements** imbued with characteristics of real-world theologies and mythologies, geared towards achieving true player immersion
- **Character progression designed** to impart understanding of social awareness, empathy, and compassion, as players deconstruct systems for min/max gameplay
- **Designed for mid-core players** for maximum re-playability and versatility

---

## Character Progression Design

### Core System
All characters begin as undifferentiated combatants with access to core Skills purchased with Skill points, earned through traditional, experience-based leveling.

### Secondary Attribute System
Class-like differentiation is achieved through a **Secondary Attribute system**, where players gain experience in:
- **Awareness**
- **Empathy**
- **Compassion**

Experience is gained based on:
- **Non-kill combat outcomes**
- **Player Quest decisions & outcomes**
- **Use of Meditation skill** (1x daily)
- **Ride** (mini-game, limited)

Points earned in Secondary Attributes can be spent on Abilities in their corresponding Discipline, unlocking progressively powerful abilities in their Discipline Tree.

## The Three Disciplines

### The Ji'hi (Empathy & Awareness)
*"Empathy & Awareness"*

Ji'hi are ardent followers of Jihai, who taught that mercy and compassion were the truest path for warriors. Though their skills in battle are unmatched, they have honed their combat abilities to preserve the delicate balance between Life and Death.

**Role:** Enhanced Combat specialists

---

### The Jorikai (Awareness & Compassion)
*"Awareness & Compassion"*

Joriki taught his followers that a disciplined mind could harness the energies and vibrations of the world and will its Chaos into Order. Jorikai are masterfully in tune with the will and intent of those around them, and wield these palpable currents to restore balance to their world.

**Role:** Spell-Combatants

---

### The Jivan (Compassion & Empathy)
*"Compassion & Empathy"*

The Jivan understand the ethereal nature of Jiva's teaching. A humble healer, she sought solace from the world's suffering in solitude. It is in the wilds that she came to understand that to heal those around you, one must heal the self; and to heal the self, one must heal their world.

**Role:** Healer Hybrids (Combat, Spell-Combat)

---

## Character Creation

### Step 1: Choose Tribe
Choice of 7 playable races with unique racial bonuses; bonuses are not significant in difference.

### Step 2: Design Appearance
Standard selection of features.

### Step 3: Select Adherence
Choice of 4 philosophical teachings that introduce Player to the mythos of the world:
- Chosen Adherence provides a starting boost to secondary attributes that align with Discipline system
- 1 Adherence offers equal starting distribution of secondary attributes

---

## Strife & Balance System

### Zone States
In a world out of balance, Zones begin in a state of **Strife**.

**Strife increases mistrust and hostility of Zone inhabitants:**
- Zone inhabitants are enraged by you → Zone spawns hostile mobs
- Zone inhabitants do not trust you → Quest NPCs do not grant quests
- Zone inhabitants are not working → Closed shops; buildings damaged and inaccessible

### Strife Reduction Levels
Player must reduce Zone's Strife to unlock content:

- **70% Strife:** Decrease hostile inhabitants (de-spawn)
- **70% Strife:** Gain access to Side Quests (NPCs active)
- **60% Strife:** Gain access to buildings and shops (Open)
- **50% Strife:** Gain access to Story Campaign (NPCs active)

**Note:** Zone's Strife does not need to reach 0 for Player to pass Zone.

### Methods to Reduce Strife
1. **Show Mercy:** Killing hostile mobs awards loot & resources but will **not** reduce Strife
2. **End combat without killing:** Mob inhabitant is cleansed of Strife's corruption; reduces Strife and awards secondary experience
3. **Repair Zone:** Use gathered resources to tend to Zone's damaged natural elements, repair and restore Zone's buildings
4. **Questing:** Completing Side Quests and Story Campaign

---

## Follower System

### Core Mechanics
- Player can have a **maximum of 5 active Followers** at any time
- Follower options are unlocked through Story Campaign progression
- **Total 3 Followers** will be available per Zone; each will be a central protagonist to the Zone's Story Campaign chapters

### Follower Management
- Player decides whether to bind a particular Follower, or not, and which Followers to bind
- Followers will be designed to buff gameplay for a specific Discipline, or reduced buff to 2 Disciplines to support hybrid gameplay
- Player can choose to make a meaningful exchange of Followers by using Meditation to release a current Follower
  - Meditation will **not** generate secondary experience in this instance
  - Previously released Followers can be re-bound

### Ultimate Abilities
- **At 5 Followers:** Player will unlock an "Ultimate" ability based on the existing Combination of the Player Character's followers
- "Ultimates" are powerful abilities meant to change gameplay in a meaningful way

## Relationship to Existing ReinMaker Codebase

### Similarities
- **Seven Tribes:** Both systems feature seven tribes/elements (Light, Stone, Metal, Code, Air, Water, Fire)
- **Educational Focus:** Both emphasize empathy, awareness, and compassion
- **Quest System:** Both have quest-based progression
- **Story-Driven:** Both prioritize narrative and player agency

### Differences

| Aspect | Existing Runner Game | Mobile RPG Positioning |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Genre** | Side-scrolling runner | First-person ARPG |
| **Combat** | Obstacle avoidance | Non-kill combat system |
| **Progression** | Knowledge Stones, XP | Skill points + Secondary Attributes |
| **Disciplines** | None (tribes only) | Three Disciplines (Ji'hi, Jorikai, Jivan) |
| **Systems** | Simple quest completion | Strife & Balance, Follower system |
| **Target Age** | All ages (2-102) | 25-44 years old |
| **Platform** | Mobile/web | Mobile-focused (5G) |

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Shared Lore:** The Seven Tribes concept can bridge both games
2. **Character Consistency:** Kelly Rein could appear in both contexts
3. **Asset Reuse:** Knowledge Stones, art assets, and narrative elements
4. **Unified Brand:** Both serve the ReinMaker mission of education through entertainment
