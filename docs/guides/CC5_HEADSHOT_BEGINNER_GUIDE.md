4. **Processing time: 2-5 minutes**
   - Progress bar shows conversion
   - Wait for completion

5. **Result:**
   - Character is now CC5 HD format
   - Higher mesh quality
   - Better for final rendering

## STEP 11: Add Hair (The Realistic Hair Challenge)

### The Hair Problem You Identified:

**You're RIGHT about the hair issue:**
- Most CC5/iClone hair = soft, flowy, game-like
- Realistic sitting/portrait hair = weighted, structured, settled

3. **Look for these hair types (more realistic):**
   - "Long Straight" (sits naturally)
   - "Professional" or "Business" styles
   - "Ponytail" (weighted, pulled back)
   - **Avoid:** "Wavy", "Flowing", "Dynamic" = too game-like

4. **Preview hair before applying:**
   - **LEFT CLICK on hair thumbnail**
   - Preview appears on character
   - If you like it: **Double LEFT CLICK** or click "Apply" button

**Option 2: Purchase Realistic Hair Pack**

   - Find **"Physics"** or **"Dynamics"** settings

3. **Reduce bounce/flow:**
   - "Stiffness": Increase to 80-100% (less movement)
   - "Damping": Increase to 70-90% (settles faster)
