## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO WATCH

### **If Kelly is Bald:**
1. Check Content Panel → Hair folder
2. Try "Hair HD" or "Hair 4K" options
3. Apply hair AFTER head generation
4. Verify hair visibility in viewport

### **If Quality Looks 2K:**
1. Verify SubD levels are at maximum (4)
2. Check export resolution settings
3. Confirm render settings in iClone
4. Try re-exporting with higher settings

### **If Export Fails:**
1. Reduce SubD temporarily for export
2. Check available disk space (8K needs lots of space)
3. Export without hair first, then add hair in iClone
4. Use lower quality for initial testing
